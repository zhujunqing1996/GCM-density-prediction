# GCM density prediction
This code is used to predict the density of compounds in liquid phase based on a group-contribution method (GCM). The method is developed by Mathieu and Bouteloup. More details of the method are in Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2016, 55, 12970−12980 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03809).

Input: an excel spreadsheet with the names and SMILES of the compounds of interest (the SMILES are necessary for the prediction and the names are just identifiers for user's reference)

Ouput: the same excel spreadsheet with predicted density (ρ in g/ml),	predicted	molar volume (Vm in ml/mol), and molecular weight (MW in g/mol).
